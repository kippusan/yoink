<p align="center">yoink is a self-hosted music library manager that lets you search, download, tag, and organize your collection from multiple sources all from a single, clean web interface</p>

> [!WARNING]
> yoink is under active development and is **not production ready**. Expect breaking changes, incomplete features, and rough edges. **Do not point yoink at your main music library** — use a separate copy or a fresh directory until the project stabilizes.

## What Is Yoink?

I ran my Lidarr instance for years, but it was really, thightly coupled to its metadata source. (MusicBrainz if I remember correctly?)
Some of the stuff I like to listen to is not well represented there, as well as new stuff that artists just drop without any announcement.
I also had issues finding good quality downloads for some of the less mainstream music on larger indexers.

yoink was created to solve these issues by leveraging a multi-provider architecture, where you can pull in metadata from multiple sources (currently Tidal, Deezer and MB are supported) and download them via hifi-api and SoulSeek.
This way (just like in IT security) you can use multiple metadata sources to cover each other's gaps.

## Key Features

- **Unified multi-provider search**: you search artists/albums/songs across all providers at once
- **Hi-res downloads**: You can download the highest quality stuff directly from hifi instances. No need for indexers and external DL clients
- **Artist profiles**: Unified artist pages combine a single artist from all of your providers (you still have to manually add them)
- **Lightweight & fast** — Built with Rust for minimal resource usage; runs happily on a Raspberry Pi or a [BEEFY COMPUTER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMGEO4URQqQ)

### Supported Providers

| Provider        | Type                 | Notes                                                        |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Tidal**       | Streaming / Download | Uses a [hifi-api](https://github.com/binimum/hifi-api) proxy |
| **Deezer**      | Metadata             | Metadata only                                                |
| **MusicBrainz** | Metadata             | Open music database for enrichment                           |
| **SoulSeek**    | P2P / Download       | Via [slskd](https://github.com/slskd/slskd)                  |

## Installation

### Docker Compose (Recommended)

Create a `compose.yaml` (or use the [example](compose.yaml) included in the repo) and run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The web UI will be available at **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**. Data is persisted in a named volume and your music library is mounted at `/music`.

See the [compose.yaml](compose.yaml) for all available environment variables and optional slskd integration.

### From Source

#### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (stable toolchain)
- [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) (manages cargo-leptos and sqlx-cli automatically)

#### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FlyinPancake/yoink.git
cd yoink
mise install # this installs cargo-leptos and sqlx-cli, which are required for development and running the app from source
```

Copy the example environment file and configure your providers:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then start yoink:

```bash
mise run dev
```

The web UI will be available at **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**.

### SoulSeek / slskd

To use SoulSeek as a download source, you'll need a running [slskd](https://github.com/slskd/slskd) instance. A convenience compose file is included:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.dev.yaml up -d
```

Then enable SoulSeek in your `.env`:

```env
SOULSEEK_ENABLED=true
SLSKD_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5030
```

## Configuration

All configuration is done via environment variables. See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for the full list. Here are the highlights:

| Variable                       | Description                       | Default    |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `MUSIC_ROOT`                   | Where tagged downloads are saved  | `./music`  |
| `DEFAULT_QUALITY`              | Preferred audio quality           | `LOSSLESS` |
| `DOWNLOAD_LYRICS`              | Auto-fetch lyrics from LRCLib     | `false`    |
| `DOWNLOAD_MAX_PARALLEL_TRACKS` | Concurrent track downloads (1–16) | `1`        |
| `TIDAL_ENABLED`                | Enable Tidal provider             | `true`     |
| `DEEZER_ENABLED`               | Enable Deezer provider            | `true`     |
| `MUSICBRAINZ_ENABLED`          | Enable MusicBrainz provider       | `true`     |
| `TIDAL_API_BASE_URL`           | hifi-api URL                      | —          |
| `SOULSEEK_ENABLED`             | Enable SoulSeek via slskd         | `false`    |

## Built With

yoink is built with **Rust** end-to-end — [Leptos](https://leptos.dev/) for the full-stack web UI with WebAssembly hydration, [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) for the server, [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) via [SQLx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx) for storage, and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. No Node.js runtime just a single binary and a database file.
